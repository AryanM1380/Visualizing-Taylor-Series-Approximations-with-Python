# Taylor Series Visualizer

This project is an interactive visualization tool that demonstrates how the Taylor series approximates complex functions using a sum of simpler polynomial terms.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

To visually show how Taylor series approximate functions like \(e^x\), \(\sin(x)\), \(\cos(x)\), and others around a center point \(a\). The visualization includes both the original function and its Taylor polynomial approximation for a varying number of terms.

## Features

- Plot original functions and their Taylor series approximations.
- Animate the approximation to show how adding more terms improves accuracy.
- Supports multiple functions including exponential, trigonometric, logarithmic, and rational functions.
- Easily extendable to new functions.

## Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook `taylor_series_visualizer.ipynb` to interact with the plots and animations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
